## Brainstorm Prompts

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
One of the most interesting topics we covered this quarter was the application of spatial null models (like the spin test) to compare brain maps. 
I found it fascinating how these methods correct for spatial autocorrelation when correlating cortical features such as thickness, myelination, or gene expression. 
It’s a unique intersection of statistics and neuroscience that changes how we interpret brain data.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For my Quarter 2 project, I would like to investigate how structural brain features such as cortical thickness and myelination relate to mental health outcomes. 
Specifically, I’m interested in correlating maps of cortical thinning and developmental expansion with large-scale datasets that include measures of depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia risk.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I would expand the project by including additional null models beyond the spin test to test the robustness of our findings. 
This would allow us to verify whether the spatial dependencies we observe are specific to the brain’s geometry or generalizable across different statistical assumptions.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’d be interested in incorporating machine learning methods to predict cortical feature patterns from genetic data. 
I also want to explore network-based analyses, examining whether brain regions connected in structural or functional networks show correlated thinning or expansion patterns.
Combining these approaches could reveal higher-order organizational principles of the brain beyond surface-level correlations.
